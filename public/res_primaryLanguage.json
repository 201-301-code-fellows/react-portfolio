      "description": "ðŸ‘‹ I'm Lewis Benson. I enjoy web development and learning new techniques and technologies. I started by learning python as a hobby and found that I had a passion for coding. After finishing a Python course, I began learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I picked up express and paired it with MongoDB to create my first web application. I attended a coding school to learn more advanced and semantic approaches to development. Reach out to me on Linkedin!",
